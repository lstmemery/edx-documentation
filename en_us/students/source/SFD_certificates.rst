Receiving and Sharing edX Certificates
######################################

.. The Open edX Learner's Guide also includes a Certificates topic, but it has
.. no shared content with this topic and there is no "Certificates" file in the
.. Shared folder.

.. note::
  Not all courses offer certificates. In the past, edX also offered honor code
  certificates, which are no longer available. If you earned an honor code
  certificate in the past, you can still access your certificate through your
  :ref:`dashboard<SFD Learner Dashboard>`. For more information, see `News
  About edX Certificates`_.

  Additionally, some edX courses offer academic credit. The requirements and
  steps for earning certificates in these courses are different. For more
  information, see :ref:`SFD Academic Course Credit`.

EdX certificates are web certificates that you can :ref:`share<SFD Sharing a
Certificate>` and :ref:`print<Print a Web Certificate>`. Certificates show
that you have successfully completed a course.

.. note::
  Certificates for courses completed before September 2015 are in PDF format.

The following topics provide information about edX certificates.

******************
About Certificates
******************

EdX currently offers the following types of certificates.

* :ref:`Verified track certificates<SFD Verified Certificates>` for single
  courses.

* :ref:`Program certificates<SFD XSeries Certificates>` for a program, or
  series of courses, such as a MicroMasters program.


.. _SFD Verified Certificates:

=====================
Verified Certificates
=====================

Most, but not all, courses on edx.org offer :ref:`verified tracks<Enroll in
the Verified Track>` of study, from which you can earn verified certificates.
For more information about the benefits of verified certificates, and to see
an example of a verified certificate, see `Verified Certificates`_. For a list
of all courses that offer verified certificates, see the `edX course
catalog`_.

To earn a verified certificate from an edX course, you enroll in or upgrade to
the verified track in the course, pay the certificate fee, :ref:`verify your
identity<SFD Verify Your Identity>` using a webcam and a photo ID, and earn a
passing grade.

Verified certificates include the following information.

  To verify or change your full name before your certificate is issued,

* The names and signatures of one or more members of the course team.
* The date, in universal coordinated time (UTC), when the certificate was
  issued.
* A URL that others can visit to verify the authenticity of the certificate.

.. note::
  Verified certificates do not include your final grade in the course or the
  number of credit hours that a university might offer for the course. Your
  final grade appears on your **Progress** page and on your dashboard. If you
  need a record of your grade, you can print your **Progress** page or
  dashboard.

     The certificate opens in a new browser page.

     ID.

  #. Use the following URL, replacing ``certificate_ID`` with the certificate
     ID that you copied.

     ::

       https://courses.edx.org/certificates/<certificate_ID>

     For example, your certificate URL might resemble the following URL.

Facebook and Twitter. Others can visit the URL to view your certificate.
